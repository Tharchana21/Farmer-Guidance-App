# Farmer-Guidance-App
 Farmer Guidance App, is well-structured, utilizing both hardware (microcontroller for soil moisture) and software (Android Studio, Java, XML). Here's a recap of what you've shared, along with some key focus areas and possible improvements:

Key Components:
Frontend (XML):

Used to define the user interface, including search boxes, text views, and other UI components.
Handles user interaction and communicates with the backend for data processing.
Backend (Java):

A decision tree algorithm processes soil moisture data from a microcontroller to recommend suitable crops.
Interacts with a remote server for data storage (crop types, soil information).
Manages database operations using SQLite for local storage and HTTP for remote communication.
SQLite:

A lightweight database used for local storage of data like user preferences and crop/soil details.
Challenges Faced:
Difficulty in processing data for accurate crop recommendations.
Solved issues by researching articles and improving the data processing methods.
